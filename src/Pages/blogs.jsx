    <h1>The History of Semengguh</h1>

    Semenggoh Wildlife Centre enables tourists to interact with wild orang utans
    and enjoy the orang utans feeding time for the amazing experience. For more
    than thirty years, Semenggoh’s staffs have trained young orang utans how to
    survive in the wild. The programme has successfully provided those orang
    utans, which had been orphaned or rescued from captivity, to have their
    freedom by living in a natural habitat.

    The tour operators usually arrange trips to Semenggoh Wildlife Centre
    combining with other local attractions. With the potential attraction and
    marketability of Semenggoh Wildlife Centre, it is vitally important to look
    into the tourists’ perceptions towards destination competitiveness. To date,
    destination competitiveness research has been matured enough to clearly
    define the competitiveness and data gathering is likely to be more feasible
    and reliable. This is evident from the research by Liu (2006), who asserts
    that the Malaysian context in rural tourism is mostly related to the
    determined ethnic disparities, geographically, socio-culturally and
    economically.

    Jenkins (1999) conducted a research on the conception of destination images
    as perceived by tourists and those reflected in different academic subjects
    and also by practitioners. According to Lawson and Bovy (1977), definition
    for destination image refers to the expression of all imaginations,
    objective knowledge and emotional thoughts of a group of people or even an
    individual. To improve and sustain destination competitiveness, it is vital
    to acknowledge that higher tourist satisfaction level should be established
    by creating a positive post-purchase tourist behaviour Yoon &amp; Uysal,
    2003. In such case, Alegre and Garau 2010 conducted a survey to examine the
    tourists’ overall satisfaction and dissatisfaction as well as their
    intention to return to the specific destination. Nature resources refer to
    the naturally occurring sources of wealth for a specific region which may
    consist of land, forests, mineral deposits and water that occur in nature
    and can be used for economic gain. Nature resources are important for human
    to survive and contribute to the economy of the nation in which they exist.
    Mazilu (2012) defined destination as a complex element connecting
    geographical resources or the natural and anthropic dimensions that are
    accessible by tourists. Dugulan, Balaure, Popescu and Veghes (2010) strongly
    agree that natural resources and cultural heritage are two important facets
    in tourism’s sustainable development. Such contribution is crucial to the
    whole competitiveness of the tourism industry and its performances by
    qualitative point of view. As cited in Dugulan, et.al. (2010), Lumsdon
    (1997) proposes that natural resource is one of the main pillars to support
    tourist destination competitiveness.
